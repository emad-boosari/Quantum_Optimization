# Quantum Optimization

This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) within the realm of quantum computing. It covers various quantum optimization methods, with detailed explanations and examples. The methods included are:

1. Quantum Annealing (QA)
2. Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
3. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
4. Grover Adaptive Search (GAS)

Each section of this repository has been designed to guide you through the fundamentals of these techniques and demonstrate their applications to solving complex optimization problems.
